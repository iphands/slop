## 2026-06-18 — Plan 23: brain plugin core (trait Brain)
- Goal: introduce `trait Brain` + `BrainKind` factory; existing brain implements it; zero behavior change.
- Seam shape: `brain::brains::core` holds `trait Brain` + bundled I/O (`BrainContext<'a>`,
  `BrainOutput`, `BrainConfig`, `BrainMap`); `brains::mod` holds `BrainKind` enum +
  `build_brain(kind, skill, cfg) -> Box<dyn Brain + Send>` (mirrors `NavMode`/`build_navigator`).
- Seam shipped: `trait Brain` (set_map/tick/on_kill/on_death/heatmap_weights/status) in
  `brains::core`; `BrainKind::Main` + `build_brain` factory in `brains::mod`. Root `brain::Brain`
  export flipped from the concrete struct to the **trait**; the binary owns `Box<dyn Brain + Send>`.
- `tick` body is **byte-identical** to Plan 22 — the only change is the signature: it now
  destructures `BrainContext { view, nav, cm, dt, ticks }` / `set_map` destructures `BrainMap`.
  Pure adapter; no decision logic touched.
- Cosmetic change: periodic log used `brain.behavior()` (`Debug` of `BehaviorState`) → now
  `brain.status()` (`&str` label: roam/hunt/engage/flee/pickup). `behavior()` kept `#[cfg(test)]`
  for the typed-state unit test. Core stays decoupled from `BehaviorState` (main-specific).
- Surprise / process note: a trait extraction that changes signatures can't keep the binary
  green between "impl trait" and "update caller", so T3 folded `bot_task`'s 3 call sites into the
  same commit (inseparable). Used `use brain::brains::core::Brain as _` transiently in T3, then
  T5 made the root `Brain` the trait and switched construction to `build_brain`.
- Verification: `cargo build`/`clippy -D warnings`/`cargo test` (all 18 test binaries) green;
  `BrainConfig::default` combat-on/no-override + `build_brain(Main).status()=="roam"` asserted.
  **Live `connect-one`/`spawn-to-*` NOT run this session — server `noir40.lan` unreachable.**
  Behaviour-preserving by construction (adapter only); flag a live A/B once a server is up.
